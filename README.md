<h1>🏡 House Price Prediction</h1>

An end-to-end machine learning project to predict house prices using regression models. Built with Python and deployed via a Flask web app to demonstrate data science, model engineering, and full-stack skills.

<b>🔍 Project Overview:</b>
This project develops and deploys a House price prediction system using historical housing data. It involves:
- Data preprocessing & feature engineering  
- Model training, evaluation & comparison  
- Serialization of the model pipeline  
- Web interface to input house features and predict pricing  

It aims to showcase skills in machine learning, data engineering,  & full-stack deployment — making it ideal work sample material for roles in Data Science, Machine Learning Engineering, or Predictive Analytics.

<b>🛠️ Key Features & Components:</b>
- Data Handling & Feature Engineering 
  Clean, transform, and engineer features from raw housing data to improve model accuracy.
- Model Training & Evaluation
  Train multiple regression models (e.g. linear regression, tree-based) and compare performance metrics (RMSE, MAE, R²).
- Pipeline & Serialization
  Build a robust data + model pipeline and serialize it (e.g. using `pickle` or `joblib`) for reuse in production.
- Web Application (Flask)
  A user-friendly UI where users enter house attributes and get a price prediction in real time.
